# About Me

![cowboy]

## Enterprise Architect

I am an Enterprise Architect with over 20 years of experience in the IT industry. I've worked mostly
in development, but have experience with technical architecture, Azure, AWS, sysadmin, a bit of network
engineering, and so on. My interests today are around modern cloud native architecture, both from an
infrastructure perspective, and from an app architecture one.

## Cloud Native

Cloud Native is not a buzzword. It's a collection of technology choices that significantly improve the
resilience, maintainability, performance, and scalability of an application. I've spent many months
researching many SaaS and PaaS services that can replace traditional IaaS architecture. Our organization
has largely lifted and shifted on-premises infrastructure to cloud providers, but we are only now starting
to look at replacing traditional VMs with more specialized services.

## AI

While far from an expert in AI, I have spent a fair amount of time learning about many of the publicly
available AIs and their strengths and weaknesses. I enjoy thinking about AI ethics and regulation, and look
for a world where AI is a capable servant, and humans are well-able to make best use of them.
