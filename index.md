Hello! I've been on Github pages now for a while, and the content mostly ported
over. I hope that you've found the two rollup articles about event-driven
architecture and a development Kubernetes environment helpful. I'm working now
on a simple application to demonstrate Event-Driven Architecture using Python,
Memphis.dev, EventStoreDB, and MongoDB. This application will run well on
Kubernetes, and serves as a guide to building larger Event-Drive applications on
Kuberenetes.
